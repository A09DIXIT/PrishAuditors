      question: "What is Money Laundering?",
      answer:
        "Money laundering is defined as any financial or banking transaction aimed at concealing or changing the source of illegally obtained funds, by passing it through the financial and banking system to make it appear as originating from legitimate sources, and then re-pumping and investing it illegally.",

      question: "What is Terrorist Financing?",
      answer:
        "Terrorism is the unlawful threat of action designed to compel the government or an international organization or intimidate the public or a section of the public to advance a political, religious, or ideological belief or cause. Terrorist Financing (TF), therefore, is where funds are generated through a legitimate source such as donations, or illegal activities such as the drug trade or fraud. These funds are normally used to support the agenda or cause of a terrorist organization.",

    {
      question: "What is the difference between Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing?",
      answer:
        "With TF, the proceeds are used to carry out illegal activities designed to intimidate or cause disruption to public safety and are not necessarily from an illegal source. ML, on the other hand, emphasizes the concealment of the proceeds of criminal activity from detection. With both these crimes, however, the perpetrators seek to mask the nexus between themselves and the sources of their funding.",

      answer: (
        <>
          <p>Money laundering is the act of concealing the origin of illegally earned money. Let’s say a financial criminal has earned money through drug smuggling, trafficking, etc., and wants to hide the black money from law enforcement bodies. For this, the criminal will devise a strategy and place it in a bank account, or casino or even invest it somewhere. Money laundering works in the following three stages:</p>
          <p><strong>Placement:</strong> This is the first stage where black money is segregated into small amounts and placed in a financial infrastructure like a bank.</p>
          <p><strong>Layering:</strong> Now, black money is transacted multiple times through sales and purchases. For instance, the fraudster might convert some amount of money into bank drafts or invest in real estate as well.</p>
          <p><strong>Integration:</strong> This is the final stage when illegal money is brought into the economy. Integration is done by fake loans, shell companies, bogus invoices, etc.</p>
